# Tango Logic Puzzle Game

A web-based implementation of the Tango (Tangly) logic puzzle game with an intelligent solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques.

## Game Overview

Tango is a visual logic puzzle where players must fill a 6x6 grid with sun and moon symbols following specific rules:

- Each row and column must contain exactly 3 suns and 3 moons
- No more than 2 of the same symbol may appear consecutively (horizontally or vertically)
- Cells connected by = must contain the same symbol
- Cells connected by X must contain opposite symbols
- Each puzzle has one unique solution solvable through logical deduction

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click to cycle through sun, moon, or empty cells
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzles
- **Intelligent Solver**: CSP-based solver with step-by-step explanations
- **Hint System**: Get logical hints without revealing the entire solution
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on constraint violations
- **Timer**: Track your solving time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ with Vite
- CSS Modules for styling
- Axios for API communication
- React hooks for state management

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python)
- OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction
- Pydantic for data validation
- Uvicorn ASGI server

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## Quick Start

### Using the provided scripts:

1. Start the backend:
```bash
./scripts/start-backend.sh
```

2. Start the frontend:
```bash
./scripts/start-frontend.sh
```

### Using the launcher script:
```bash
python run_game.py
```

## How to Play

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard
2. **Place Symbols**: Click cells to cycle through: empty -> sun -> moon -> empty
3. **Follow the Rules**: 
   - Each row/column needs 3 suns and 3 moons
   - Avoid 3 consecutive identical symbols
   - Respect = (same) and X (different) constraints
4. **Use Hints**: Click "Get Hint" if you're stuck
5. **Complete the Puzzle**: Fill all cells correctly to win!
