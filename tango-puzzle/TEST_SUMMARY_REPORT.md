    }
  ]
}
```

## Manual UI Verification Checklist

Please verify these UI elements manually:

- [ ] 6×6 game grid displays correctly
- [ ] Sun and moon symbols are visible
- [ ] Constraint indicators (= and ×) show between cells
- [ ] Click interaction cycles: empty → sun → moon → empty
- [ ] Timer starts on first move
- [ ] Invalid moves highlight in red
- [ ] Success message on puzzle completion

## Test Execution Commands
