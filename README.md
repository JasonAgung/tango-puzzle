# Tango Logic Puzzle Game

This repository contains a complete implementation of the Tango logic puzzle game with an intelligent solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques.

## Why This Project?

While Tango puzzles exist online, automated solvers for this puzzle type are scarce, especially those utilizing constraint satisfaction approaches. This project addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive CSP-based solver with educational value for understanding constraint programming.

## Repository Structure

- **`tango-puzzle/`** - Main project directory containing the game implementation
- **`reference/`** - Reference materials and research papers
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project specifications and requirements
- **`PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.txt`** - Detailed project documentation
- **`TANGO_ALGORITHM_EXPLANATION.txt`** - Algorithm explanation and solving strategies

## Quick Start

To run the Tango puzzle game:

```bash
cd tango-puzzle
python run_game.py
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Tango Puzzle README](tango-puzzle/README.md).
